### Playing around with different models

1. Random Forest Regressor with StandardScalar and RMSLE <br>
***Accuracy : 0.021***

2. Light GBM with StandardScalar and RMSLE <br>
***Accuracy : 0.025***

3. ExtraTrees Regressor with StandardScalar and RMSLE <br>
***Accuracy : 0.017***

*P.S - The above models are used with defualt configurations, and using Gridsearch for parameter tunning
didn't help much.*
